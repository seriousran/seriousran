✨ I am a developer who creates non-linear growth through chance encounters in an uncertain world.

⚡ I am passionate about using machine learning to solve human problems and contribute to fundamental science research. 
⚡ I am actively researching in the area of multimodal and currently focusing on generative models. 

🌱 I founded a non-profit community based on machine learning and data science called Pseudo Lab, where we run academic programs, various social activities, and various events. 
🔭 With the core values of sharing, motivation, and delighted to work together, we strive to develop a new type of growth system that has never existed before, bridge the gap in education, and create opportunities for growth and achievement.
